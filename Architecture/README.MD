## üß† Project Purpose

This project is designed to simulate and process social media posts in order to identify sentiment related to **insurance products**. It helps analyze public perception by filtering relevant posts and applying privacy-respecting preprocessing, which includes Personally Identifiable Information (PII) handling.

---

## üîß Features

- ‚úÖ **Mock Data Generation**: Generates 500 realistic posts per platform (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn).
- ‚úÖ **Ingestion Pipelines**: Reads mock data, filters insurance-related content, and sanitizes PII.
- ‚úÖ **PII Protection**: Names and usernames are removed or hashed using SHA-256.
- ‚úÖ **Structured Outputs**: Writes both sanitized and raw versions of the data.
- ‚úÖ **Organized Folder Structure**: Clean separation of raw vs. processed data for compliance.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Set Up Python Environment

Create a virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # Mac/Linux
.env\Scriptsctivate       # Windows
```

### Step 2: Install Project Dependencies

Install all necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Use

### Step 1: Generate Social Media Mock Data

This step creates sample JSON files with 500 social media posts per platform:

```bash
python generate_mock_data.py
```

Output files will be saved in the `Data/` folder:
- `twitter_mock.json`
- `facebook_mock.json`
- `instagram_mock.json`
- `linkedin_mock.json`

---

### Step 2: Run the Ingestion Pipelines

This filters insurance-related posts, removes sensitive user details, and writes sanitized versions to `Ingested/`.

```bash
python run_ingestion.py
```

Outputs:
- `Ingested/twitter_insurance.json`
- `Ingested/facebook_insurance.json`
- `Ingested/instagram_insurance.json`
- `Ingested/linkedin_insurance.json`
- `Ingested/raw/` ‚Üí Raw, PII-containing original files

---

## üîê Data Privacy & PII Protection

This project includes built-in mechanisms for GDPR and POPIA compliance:

- No names or usernames are stored or logged.
- Sensitive fields are removed or hashed (SHA-256).
- Raw data is separated from cleaned output in `Ingested/raw/`.
- Sanitization logic resides in `Ingestion/pii_sanitizer.py`.
