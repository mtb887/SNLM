# White Paper: Social Media Sentiment Analysis Platform for Insurance Insights

## Executive Summary

This white paper presents a comprehensive architecture and implementation strategy for a cloud-based sentiment analysis platform designed to ingest, process, and analyze data from social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter (X), and LinkedIn. Built specifically for the insurance sector, the platform enables real-time monitoring and historical analysis of customer sentiment, helping organizations extract actionable insights from public discourse.

The architecture is built on modern big data and cloud-native components, ensuring scalability, resilience, and data privacy compliance. The solution leverages multi-layered storage zones—Bronze, Silver, and Gold—each designed for specific transformations and access patterns.

## 1. Introduction

The increasing volume of social media content provides a rich source of customer feedback and behavioral insights. For insurance companies, understanding public sentiment around claims, customer service, premiums, and product offerings can directly inform marketing strategies, risk assessments, and product development.

This platform addresses that need with an end-to-end architecture that combines open-source and managed cloud technologies for seamless, secure, and real-time sentiment intelligence.

---

## 2. Source Layer

### Social Media Platforms
- **Twitter (X)** via Twitter API v2 with streaming endpoint
- **Facebook** via Meta Graph API
- **Instagram** via Meta Graph API
- **LinkedIn** via LinkedIn Developer Platform

All APIs are authenticated using OAuth 2.0 and deliver JSON-structured content including text, metadata, and engagement metrics.

---

## 3. Ingestion Layer

### Technologies
- **Python ingestion scripts** for API integration
- **boto3** for direct writes to Amazon S3 (batch mode)
- **Kafka (Dockerized / AWS MSK)** for real-time streaming

### Flow
Each platform has a dedicated script pulling data into:
- **S3 (batch every 2 hours)**
- **Kafka topics** for real-time use cases

PII data is identified and flagged during ingestion for downstream sanitization.

---

## 4. Messaging Layer

### Real-Time Queueing
- **Apache Kafka** is used to decouple producers and consumers.
- Each platform's stream writes to a unique Kafka topic (e.g., `twitter-stream`, `facebook-stream`).
- Allows horizontal scalability and retries in the event of ingestion failure.

---

## 5. Processing Layer (Silver Layer)

### Technologies
- **PySpark** and **Spark Structured Streaming**
- **UDFs** built with `TextBlob` and `VADER` for NLP sentiment scoring

### Functions
- Remove duplicates
- Handle null or corrupt records
- Enrich data with derived fields (e.g., sentiment score, location inference)
- Sanitize PII (e.g., remove names, hash usernames)

---

## 6. Storage & Output Layer

### Bronze Layer (Raw)
- **Amazon S3** stores all ingested raw data in JSON format
- Strict access control using IAM roles and S3 bucket policies

### Silver Layer (Cleaned)
- Data is cleansed and stored in **Parquet** format
- Stored in a separate "clean" S3 prefix with access limited to engineering and analytics teams

### Gold Layer (Curated)
- Aggregated and business-aligned metrics:
  - Sentiment by date/platform/topic
  - Engagement metrics
- Stored in:
  - **S3 Parquet (partitioned by platform/date)**
  - **PostgreSQL** for dashboard access
  - **Snowflake / Databricks** for warehouse-scale analytics

---

## 7. Orchestration Layer

### Tools
- **Apache Airflow DAGs**
- **CLI Wrappers** for local or containerized scheduling
- **AWS Step Functions** for production workflows

These orchestrate:
- Ingestion scripts
- Sanitization jobs
- Spark batch transformations
- Aggregation routines

---

## 8. Visualization Layer

### Tools
- **Power BI** for business dashboards
- **Streamlit** for interactive web-based dashboards and demos
- **Excel** (via PostgreSQL connector) for non-technical users

---

## 9. Scalability & Reliability

- Kafka handles message bursts with high throughput
- Spark supports distributed batch and real-time transformations
- S3 scales for unlimited data retention
- All components are containerized or cloud-native

---

## 10. Security & Compliance

### PII Protection
- PII fields (names, emails, usernames) are never stored or logged in raw form post-processing
- Hashed user identifiers retained for analytical joins

### Data Protection
- **Encryption at rest** (S3 SSE or KMS)
- **Encryption in transit** (HTTPS, SSL for Kafka)
- **IAM & role-based access control** on all services

### Compliance
- Design aligns with **GDPR** and **POPIA**
- Logs and access trails maintained via **AWS CloudTrail**

---

## 12. Conclusion

This platform provides a scalable, secure, and highly adaptable architecture for social media sentiment analysis tailored to the insurance sector. It integrates real-time and batch ingestion, robust data sanitization, and presentation-ready curation layers, delivering maximum insight with minimum compliance risk.
